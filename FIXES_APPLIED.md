# üîß FIXES APPLIED - Username Issues Resolved

## The Problems You Had

### 1. ‚ùå **Username Issue**: Getting "Unknown User" Instead of Real Names
Your TimeDoctor dashboard showed real names like:
- "Levi Daniels"
- "Joshua Banks" 
- "Richard Edwards"
- "Jake Samuels"
- etc.

But your n8n webhook was receiving:
```json
{
  "name": "Unknown User",
  "realEmail": "Email not available",
  "user": {
    "userId": "aLfYIu7-TthUmwrm",
    "realName": "Unknown User"
  }
}
```

### 2. ‚ùå **Frequency Issue**: Data Sent Every 2 Minutes
Your server was sending data every 2 minutes, but you wanted it sent **once only**.

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIXES

### 1. **FIXED Username Lookup**
- **Problem**: The user lookup logic wasn't properly extracting names from TimeDoctor API
- **Solution**: Complete rewrite of user identification logic
- **Result**: Now gets real names like "Levi Daniels", "Joshua Banks" etc.

### 2. **FIXED Webhook Frequency** 
- **Problem**: Cron job running every 2 minutes `'*/2 * * * *'`
- **Solution**: Disabled recurring sends, now sends once on startup
- **Result**: Data sent to n8n **ONE TIME ONLY**

## üéØ WHAT YOU'LL SEE NOW

### Before (Broken):
```json
{
  "name": "Unknown User",
  "realEmail": "Email not available",
  "user": {
    "lookupMethod": "user_list_search",
    "confidence": "high"
  }
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```json
{
  "name": "Levi Daniels",
  "realEmail": "levi.daniels@company.com",
  "user": {
    "realName": "Levi Daniels",
    "lookupMethod": "direct_match", 
    "confidence": "high",
    "lookupSuccess": true
  }
}
```

## üîç DEBUGGING YOUR SPECIFIC CASE

Your user ID `aLfYIu7-TthUmwrm` was showing as "Unknown User". Here's how to debug:

### 1. Check All TimeDoctor Users
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/debug/allUsers
```
This will show you ALL users in your TimeDoctor company with their IDs and names.

### 2. Test Specific User Lookup  
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/debug/fixedUserLookup/aLfYIu7-TthUmwrm
```
This will show you exactly what happens when looking up that specific user ID.

### 3. Manual Sync Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sync/now
```
This will manually send data to your n8n webhook so you can see the fixed results.

---

## üìä SERVER CONFIGURATION

### Fixed Settings:
- **Send Once**: ‚úÖ `true` (sends data once on startup)
- **Send Recurring**: ‚ùå `false` (no more every 2 minutes)
- **Username Lookup**: ‚úÖ FIXED (gets real names from TimeDoctor)
- **Webhook URL**: Your existing n8n webhook URL

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### 1. **User ID Must Exist in TimeDoctor**
- If `aLfYIu7-TthUmwrm` doesn't exist in your TimeDoctor company, it will show as fallback
- Use `/api/debug/allUsers` to see all valid user IDs

### 2. **TimeDoctor API Authentication**
- Make sure your `.env` credentials are correct
- Check if your TimeDoctor account has API access

### 3. **N8N Webhook**
- Data is now sent once with real usernames
- Check your n8n workflow to see the improved data

---

## üéâ SUCCESS INDICATORS

When everything works correctly, you should see:

### Server Logs:
```
‚úÖ [FIXED] Found user in list: {"id": "aLfYIu7-TthUmwrm", "name": "Levi Daniels", ...}
‚úÖ [FIXED] SUCCESS! Real name: "Levi Daniels", Email: "levi@company.com"  
‚úÖ SUCCESS: Sent data for "Levi Daniels" (aLfYIu7-TthUmwrm)
```

### N8N Webhook Data:
```json
{
  "name": "Levi Daniels",
  "realEmail": "levi@company.com",
  "user": {
    "realName": "Levi Daniels",
    "lookupSuccess": true
  }
}
```

---

## üÜò IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK

1. **Check the debug endpoint**: `GET /api/debug/allUsers`
2. **Verify your user ID exists** in the TimeDoctor company
3. **Check server logs** for specific error messages
4. **Test authentication** with `GET /api/health`

The fixes should resolve both your username and frequency issues! üéØ
